<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Bearing</li><li>Plain Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carbon bearings market comprises two main types: rolling bearings and plain bearings. Rolling bearings utilize rolling elements, such as balls or rollers, to reduce friction and support loads, offering high efficiency and low wear. They are commonly used in machinery and automotive applications. In contrast, plain bearings, also known as bushings, rely on sliding motion between surfaces, providing simple construction and ease of maintenance. Both types benefit from carbon-based materials that enhance durability and performance, particularly in high-temperature environments.</p></p>
